You are working on a calendar feature that finds a day where a group pf people are all free. Each person has a range of days they are unavailable, called a 'block'. In total there are 'N' blocks to consider. How can you find all the days where everyone is available.

One person can have more than one block and block canâ€™t overlap. An unavailability can start just before or just after another one ends. You may assume unavailabilities inclusive of start/end day

Class Block
{
int personId;
int startDay;
int endDay;
}

List findAvailability(int totalPeople, List blocks)
