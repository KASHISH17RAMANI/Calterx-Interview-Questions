1)there is a necklace of Rubys and diamonds containing 2*d number of diamonds and 2*r number of rubies, eg. RDRDDDRDRD
You have to make 2 cuts in the necklace such that number of rubys and  number of diamonds in both halves are equal
follow up : is there any optimization possible
ans: sliding window

2) Given a bot and flowing stream of string, the bot outputs messages in a not-so-human readable format. Your job is to make the output human readable by outputting a message only if it has not been output in the last 10 seconds
<timestamp>  <message>
ex. 
1 shreya is typing
2 kashish is reading
3 maybe satya is reading too
8 shreya is typing
31 shreya is typing

ans: unordered map
follow up? when will you update the map? not when you see the message within 10 seconds of its last occurrence, but when you see it from last time you printed it.

so you will update the map first at 1, then at 31, not 10
is there any way to optimize this such that we do not get memory overflow

ROUND 2

Movie Recommendation system
Given movies and their ratings: 
“Movie A has rating:6”
“Movie B has rating:7”
“Movie C has rating:8”
“Movie D has rating:9”

and given similarity between movies
“A is similar to B”
“B is similar to C”

given the value of k and a movie name, return top k rated movies that are similar to that movie.

Solution: DSU and priority queue

Round 3: Given a network of connected edges, and some nodes that have failed, return if it is possible to reach a destination starting from a source

Follow up: return the minimum distance to reach all nodes starting from source
