[10/11, 1:24 pm] +91 95113 19457: 4) given a hidden word like 
PLANE, 
You have design a game which returns the hints to the user to guess this given word using 3 rules yellow, green and red (basically like WORDLE) 
Yellow : means the specific letter is present in the word but not that location 
Red: letter not present 
Green : place and letter both correct 
The hints should be present in the dictionary also, some other constraints were also present 
Hidden word : PLANE
Yellow : AN - - -
Red : Q- - TC
Green : P - - - E
The function input is dictionary , yellow, red and green
